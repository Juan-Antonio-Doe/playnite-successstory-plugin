## Fork of eFMann: Improving Steam Emulator Achievements of SuccessStory plugin

This is an attempt to update eFMann’s fork, which is outdated (currently: 3.4.0 from original), to match the latest version from Lacro59 (currently: 3.5.0).

This is purely a personal attempt for my own use and may never be completed. At the moment, VSCode has worsened the merge attempt and VS2022 doesn’t seem to want to open the solution, so I’ve put it aside for now.

Please visit the original repositories if, for some reason, you arrived here first:

- [Fork](https://github.com/eFMann/playnite-successstory-plugin) by eFMann
